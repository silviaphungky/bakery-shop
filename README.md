There are 3 sections in this project:

1. Order form
2. Order history
3. Login form

pending development:
1. timeout for clear session every 5 second > then logout admin from the dashboard based on session data
2. set routing using react-router-dom
  
   a. privateroute for order form and order history
3. Refactor:
  
   a. Use atomic react style for coding to have efficiency code, then put it in components folder
      
      Note: atomic style will reduce repeating same component in one page or another page. For example, Input field type select can become 1 atomic component that receive props from it's parents, like the options and onChange function
